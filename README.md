# Whiplash
An array of Hand-Gesture Recognition based projects.

This era has seen more expansion in Human Computer Interaction than almost any other technology this world has been introduced to. Gone are the days when keyboard and mouse were the sole peripherals required for giving input to the system. Touchscreen, Ligh Pens, Track Pads/Balls, Joysticks, what not?!

Furthermore, Sensors like Cameras have been deployed to serve the purpose of instructing the computer to perform actions. Usage of hand-gestures to command operations is a common practice. The intention of this repository, is to use the advent of programming techniques using Computer Vision and Image Processing to go hands-free!

The name "Whiplash" is derived from the movie of the same name. Watching J.K Simmons conduct his band using the hand-codes inspired us (me and my pal) to design a hand-gesture controlled media-player. 

And why just a media player? Let the program do wonders by expanding its horizons. Just remember, the power is in your "Hands".

Hoping that the only time we need to use our hands and keyboard will be to program and write codes. Or there may come a day when even that goes hands-free.

May the force be with you!
